# Fitboard Keyboard
This repository contains the Arduino code for Fitboard. Emulates a 4 button keyboard. Can choose 'WASD' or arrow keys as the 4 buttons. 

Repository also includes an arduino sketch, Mechanical_Buttons.io, which demonstrates how four mechanical buttons can be used together with an arduino.

Mech_Buttons_LEDs.io introduces LED feedback based on the state of a button. This works using a BC337 NPN Transistor and 12V Battery.
